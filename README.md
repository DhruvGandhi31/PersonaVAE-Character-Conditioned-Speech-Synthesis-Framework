# PersonaVAE: Character-Conditioned Speech Synthesis Framework

PersonaVAE is an educational project that explores voice synthesis by simulating the voice of **Zhongli**, a character from the game *Genshin Impact*, using a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)** architecture.

The goal of this project is to experiment with deep learning–based speech generation techniques and demonstrate how character-specific voice modeling can be approached in a research context.
